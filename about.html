        <h1>About the NSDTR</h1>
        <p class = "description">The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is a medium-sized gundog bred primarily for 
            hunting. <br> It is often referred to as a "toller". <br> It is the smallest of the retrievers, 
            and is often mistaken for a small Golden Retriever. <br> Tollers are intelligent, eager to 
            please, alert, and energetic. <br> The name "toller" is derived from their ability to lure 
            waterfowl within gunshot range. <br> The breed originated in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, Canada. 
            The American Kennel Club ranks the toller as the 87th most popular dog breed.</p>
